# GUVI
Hi there GUVI team, i'm Ramakrishnan K form chemical engineering department. here are the few things that i want to tell about the project.
1.) the register page works perfectly but i didn't use js as a mediator. I directly send the request to register.php file which works as it should.
2.) in case you are running the code pls create a database named "loginandregister" and a table as named "register" with 8 coloums named 
"name", "username", "gender", "age", "dob", "contact", "email", "password".
3.) and i have written the register.php code such that it gets only unique "email", that is no user can register with same email id more than one.
4.) login page is not working and i don'y know why, but i think there is something wrong with my ajax code in login.js for login page.
